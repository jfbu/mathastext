Summary description: use text font also in math
License type: lppl

Announcement text:

The mathastext package propagates the document text font to
mathematical mode, for the letters of the Latin alphabet and,
optionally, some further ASCII-127 characters. Thus it makes
possible (for a document with simple mathematics) to use a quite
arbitrary font without worrying too much that it does not have
specially designed accompanying math fonts. Also, mathastext
provides a simple mechanism in order to use many different
choices of (text hence, now, math) fonts in the same
document (not that we recommend it!). A final aspect is that
mathastext helps produce smaller PDF files.
