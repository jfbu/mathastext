The simplest for most users is to use the manager script of the TeX
installation to either install or upgrade mathastext to its current
version.

Else, download the tds.zip

    v13/mathastext.tds.zip

and use unzip -d <TDS compliant directory>

Else, download mathastext.dtx either from CTAN or from the package
web site and follow these instructions:

- Run tex or etex on mathastext.dtx to generate the package style
  file mathastext.sty as well as additional files:

  mathastext.tex, README.md, ChangeLog.md, and some test files.

- Move the style file mathastext.sty to a location where TeX can
  find it. In a TDS compliant hierarchy this will be

      <TDS>:tex/latex/mathastext/mathastext.sty

To generate the documentation:

- On Unixen you can use after above extraction step:

  latexmk -e "\$dvipdf = q/dvipdfmx %O -o %D %S/" -pdfdvi mathastext

  Adapt quoting to your shell.

- Without latexmk: run latex thrice on mathastext.tex
  then dvipdfmx on mathastext.dvi.

The file mathastext.tex can be customized to change the font size
or set other options therein.  The produced file mathastext.pdf
will by default include the commented source code.

It is also possible to run pdflatex (thrice) directly on mathastext.dtx.
In that case mathastext.pdf is produced without the commented source code.

One can NOT use lualatex or xelatex to compile the documentation.

The test files

    mathastexttestmathversions.tex
    mathastexttestunicodemacos.tex
    mathastexttestunicodelinux.tex
    mathastexttestalphabets.tex

illustrate after conversion to pdf some features of the package
and are an addendum to the main documentation mathastext.pdf.
