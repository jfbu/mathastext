DESCRIPTION


Optimal typographical results for documents containing mathematical
symbols can only be hoped for with math fonts specifically designed to
match a given text typeface. Although the list of freely available math
fonts (alongside the Computer Modern and AMS extension fonts) is slowly
expanding (fourier, kpfonts, mathdesign, pxfonts, txfonts, newpx, newtx,
...) it remains limited, and the situation is even worse with Unicode
fonts (XeTeX/LuaTeX). So if you can't find a math font which fits well
with your favorite text font, and wish to still be able to typeset
mathematical documents, perhaps not of the highest typographical
quality, but at least not subjected to obvious visual incompatibilities
between your text font and the math fonts, try out mathastext: it will
simply use the text font also for the math!

USAGE


mathastext is a LaTeX package

      \usepackage{mathastext}

The document will use in math mode the text font as configured at
package loading time, for these characters:

      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
      ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
      0123456789
      !?,.:;+-=()[]/#$%&<>|{}\

Main options: italic, subdued, LGRgreek.

-   Use the italic option to get the Latin letters in math mode be in
    italics. Digits and log-like operator names (pre-defined as well as
    user-defined) will be in the same shape as the text font (usually
    this means upright).
-   each \Mathastext[<name>] in the preamble defines a math version to
    be later activated in the document body via the command
    \MTversion{<name>}.
-   With the subdued option, mathastext will be active only inside such
    math versions.
-   For documents needing Greek letters the following is possible:
    -   no option: Greek letters defined by other packages,
    -   eulergreek: use the Euler font for the Greek letters,
    -   symbolgreek: use the Postscript Symbol font for the Greek
        letters.
    -   LGRgreek: use the document text font in LGR encoding. Further
        options specify the shape of the lowercase and uppercase Greek
        glyphs; starting with v1.15c it is possible to use multiple
        distinct LGR fonts in the same document.
-   Commands are provided to scale the Euler and Symbol fonts by an
    arbitrary factor to let them fit better with the document text font.
-   \MTsetmathskips allows to set up extra spacings around letters.



RECENT CHANGES


1.3u (2019/08/20)

-   new feature: the initial release dealt with only one font, and
    although shortly thereafter the 1.11 version added support for
    extended math versions, it was documented that some font-dependent
    set-up (minus as endash, dotless i and j, hbar, math accents) was
    done only once. This release makes the relevant characters font
    encoding savvy in each mathastext-extended math version. Thus, they
    should render correctly even with multiple math versions using fonts
    with varying encodings.

    This reinforces importance of using \MTversion and not the LaTeX
    \mathversion when switching to a new math version (which got
    declared via the package interface). The implementation is
    compatible with Unicode engines and mixed usage of TU encoding
    (OpenType fonts) with traditional 8bits TeX font encodings. For all
    engines, all used (8bits) encodings must have been passed as options
    to the fontenc package.

    Thanks to Falk Hanisch for feature request and code suggestions.

-   new option unimathaccents: this adds to option mathaccents the
    demand to use the text font accents for OpenType fonts in math mode
    via the \Umathaccent primitive. Indeed, as my testing showed that
    this gave non-satisfactory results both with XeTeX and LuaTeX
    regarding the horizontal placement of the accents, the main option
    mathaccents acts only on 8bits encoded fonts.

-   bugfix: the \Mathastext without optional argument forgot to repeat
    some font-encoding dependent initialization set-up done originally
    during package loading.

-   bugfix: under the subdued option macros \MTmathactiveletters or
    \MTnonlettersobeymathxx now act like no-ops if issued explicitly
    while in the normal or bold math version. Formerly, this was not the
    case and could cause bugs such as a disappearing minus sign in math
    mode.

-   bugfix: the letter h used in the \hbar obeyed the extra skips as
    set-up by \MTsetmathskips, badly interfering with the horizontal
    positioning of the bar accent. They are now ignored (as well as the
    added italic correction).
