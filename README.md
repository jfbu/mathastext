DESCRIPTION
===========

Optimal typographical results for documents containing
mathematical symbols can only be hoped for with math fonts
specifically designed to match a given text typeface.
Although the list of freely available math fonts (alongside
the Computer Modern and AMS extension fonts) is slowly
expanding (fourier, kpfonts, mathdesign, pxfonts, txfonts,
newpx, newtx, ...) it remains limited, and the situation is
even worse with Unicode fonts (XeTeX/LuaTeX). So if you can't
find a math font which fits well with your favorite text
font, and wish to still be able to typeset mathematical
documents, perhaps not of the highest typographical quality,
but at least not subjected to obvious visual incompatibilities
between your text font and the math fonts, try out mathastext:
it will simply use the text font also for the math!

USAGE
=====

`mathastext` is a LaTeX package

      \usepackage{mathastext}

The document will use in math mode the text font as configured at
package loading time, for these characters:

      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
      ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
      0123456789
      !?,.:;+-=()[]/#$%&<>|{}\

Main options: `italic`, `frenchmath`, `subdued`, `LGRgreek`.
- Use the `italic` option to get the Latin letters in math mode
  be in italics. Digits and log-like operator names (pre-defined
  as well as user-defined) will be in the same shape as the text
  font (usually this means upright).
- each `\Mathastext[<name>]` in the preamble defines a math version
  to be later activated in the document body via the command
  `\MTversion{<name>}`.
- With the `subdued` option, mathastext will be active
  only inside such math versions.
- For documents needing Greek letters the following is
  possible:
  - no option: Greek letters defined by other packages,
  - `eulergreek`: use the Euler font for the Greek letters,
  - `symbolgreek`: use the Postscript Symbol font for the
     Greek letters.
  - `LGRgreek`: use the document text font in LGR encoding.
     Further options specify the shape of the lowercase
     and uppercase Greek glyphs; starting with v1.15c it is
     possible to use multiple distinct LGR fonts in the
     same document.
- Commands are provided to scale the Euler and Symbol fonts by an
  arbitrary factor to let them fit better with the document text
  font.
- `\MTsetmathskips` allows to set up extra spacings around letters.
