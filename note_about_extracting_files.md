# Extracting `mathastext.sty` and other files from `mathastext.dtx`

- prior to 1.2 release, use `etex mathastext.ins`.

- starting with 1.2, you can also use `latex mathastext.dtx`.

- starting with 1.3c, you can also use `etex mathastext.dtx`,
  and this is the recommended way from then on.

In this repository, the `mathastext.ins` file was deleted after
the commit corresponding to mathastext 1.3e 2015-09-10, at the
same time this informational note was added.  CTAN uploads ceased
containing `mathastext.ins` at 1.3u 2019-08-20.

Regarding `mathastext.sty` it is anyhow added to the commits here
since 1.13 2011-03-12.
