# Note about which PDFs are in this repository

This repository does not hold the `mathastext.pdf` official
documentation. This would have made the repository too voluminous, and there
are other reasons related to some filtering-out applied to the committed
sources here.  Even directory `v10` does not contain the PDF of the first
release but only its source.  To produce `mathastext.pdf` you only need to
follow instructions in the [README.md](README.md) (or the README in early
releases), although it is not guaranteed that building an old documentation on
a current LaTeX will succeed, because there are breaking changes happening
from time to time in either LaTeX or other files of the eco-system such as
`hyperref`.  At any rate you should work in temporary directory with the files
as extracted from `mathastext.dtx` so `mathastext.sty` is the one matching the
documentation.

Similarly this repository does not hold the other PDFs linked-to from
[mathastext.html](mathastext.html).

However PDFs linked to from [showcase.html](showcase.html) are included
here, when they are providing examples of use of the package.

Similarly, the `.zip` file of the [CTAN](https://ctan.org) uploads have not
been included, and the `xint.tds.zip` link in
[mathastext.html](mathastext.html) is broken.
