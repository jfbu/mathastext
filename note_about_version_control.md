# `mathastext.dtx` versus `mathastext.html`

Git version control for `mathastext` started only at `1.3e` of `2015-09-10`.
The version control for the author personal web site, which had hosted
`mathastext.html` ever since the initial release of `mathastext.html` in
January 2011 got initiated for real only in 2016, some previous snapshots (all
the way back to 2004) having been recovered by various means.

So until `1.3k` of January 24, 2016, only some releases are accompanied in
this archival repository with the corresponding update to the HTML site:
`1.0`, `1.13`, `1.14c`, `1.15d`, `1.15g`, `1.3a`, and `1.3d`.

For these tags, file `mathastext.dtx` (and also `mathastext.sty` starting with
the `1.13` tag) are also inside a subdirectory whose name has changed up to
being now `v14`.  All intermediates releases until `1.3m` have the
corresponding `mathastext.dtx` (and also `mathastext.sty` starting with
`1.13`) kept updated at top level, and the subdirectories `v11`, `v115`, etc
..., up to `v13` contain perhaps earlier versions.

Starting with the `1.3m` tag, things are simpler as all tagged commits update
both `mathastext.html` and files included in directory `v13`, then `v14`, and
`mathastext.dtx` is only located there and not also at top level.

This text was written on June 1st, 2025, during the archival process creating
this repository.
