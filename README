USAGE

Include in the preamble 

\usepackage{mathastext}

after other font related packages. This will make your
document use the main text font also in mathematics
mode. The default is that the letters in text and math mode
have the same shape but option `italic' will make the
letters use the italic shape in math mode. Digits and
log-like operator names will be upright (if the text font is
upright). So one can now typeset documents (containing
simple mathematics formulas) with a quite arbitrary TeX text
font, without worrying too much that nobody ever designed
accompanying math fonts. 

Options are provided to pick up the Greek letters from
either the Euler or the Symbol font, and they can be scaled
by an arbitrary factor to let them fit with the document
text font. It is also possible to have other packages set up
the fonts for Greek letters, as mathastext by default only
modify the font for Latin letters and typographical
characters.

The goal (somewhat altered by the `italic' option) was to
make documents with the difference between math and text
blurred out, so that the reader would be forced to
concentrate more on the contents: text AND math. There is no
reason to use another font for math: as the text is also an
equation in its own way, everything should be given equal
weight. For example, the package gives results corresponding
to that goal when used with typewriter fonts (possibly of
variable width like Latin Modern Typewriter
Proportional). It also gives interesting results for
calligraphical fonts.

Another feature is that mathastext provides a simple
interface to use many different fonts in the same document,
be it for math or text (not that we recommend abusing it!).

Using mathastext without the `italic' option usually reduces
the size of the final PDF file. The option `symbolmax' will
get quite a few mathematicals glyph from the postscript
Symbol font included in all LaTeX distributions, so that for
documents with simple mathematics, the default math fonts
might be completely avoided. This sometimes leads to smaller
PDF files.

INSTALLATION

Run latex on mathastext.ins to create mathastext.sty from
mathastext.dtx and put it where LaTeX can find it.

To generate documentation, including the commented source
code, run latex on mathastext.dtx

VERSION HISTORY

 {1.0}{2011/01/25}{Initial version.}

 {1.1}{2011/02/01}{
   * option |italic|: this is the main change for the user. Internally we now
   have two distinct fonts, however they differ only in shape. 
       * the mechanism of math versions is extended to accomodate this: the
       macros \cs{MathastextWillUse} and \cs{MathastextDeclareVersion} now
       accept an optional argument for specifying the letters' shape  
       * |frenchmath| sets the uppercase Latin letters nevertheless in the
       digits font 
       * \cs{mathnormal}, \cs{mathrm}, \cs{mathbf} work in the same way as in
       standard \LaTeX{}, but with the |mathastext| font. But I do nothing
       with the other default alphabet changing commands.
   * the minus sign can be represented as an en-dash. This seems to be clever
   enough to accomodate all 8bit encodings, not limited to OT1 or T1.
   * the |noplusnominus| option is split into two
   * I change the way the encoding is chosen for the math accents: I use the
   default encoding at the time of loading. So there is nothing more in the
   code at AtBeginDocument for this. I do not know an automatic way to go
   from the encoding to the accent slots, and I did not want to manually
   incorporate here all possible or at least many encodings, so basically
   only OT1 and T1 are ok. Default to OT1. Of course in case on more than one
   math versions, they should have the same encoding for everything to work
   everywhere. 
   * same change for \cs{imath}: but defaults to T1.
   * some attention devoted to |hbar|. Works ok, or at least reasonably with
   the fonts I tested. Adjusts to whether or not the |italic| option was used. 
   * |defaultvec| deprecated, rather we now have \cs{fouriervec} command to
   access the vec accent from the Fourier font. 
   * new alphabet commands \cs{mathnormalbold}, \cs{MathEulerBold}, and
   \cs{MathEuler} and \cs{MathPSymbol} have new names.
   * names for the capital Greek letters which look like their Latin versions.
   * bug fixed: the character slot for \cs{Xi} in the Symbol font was wrong.
   **** limitations: 
        * the \cs{pmvec} accent will not change its size when
        used in subscripts or exponents
        * now that internally we have two fonts for letters and
        digits they could be entirely unrelated, it is just a
        question of providing the user macros to pass the info to
        the package, and to duplicate some variables. As this
        goes really against the initial design goals, and adds
        complications, I did not do it.}
