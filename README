This is the README file for the LaTeX2e package `mathastext',
version 1.13b, 2011/03/15

	The files of this package may be distributed and/or modified

	LaTeX version 2003/12/01 or later.


                        INSTALLATION

Run latex on mathastext.ins to create mathastext.sty from
mathastext.dtx and put it where LaTeX can find it.

To generate documentation, including the commented source code, run
latex on mathastext.dtx

Numerous examples of use are available at 

           mathsastext.html


                            USAGE

              \usepackage[options]{mathastext}
              after other font related packages

main options: 
   italic, LGRgreek, eulergreek, symbolgreek, defaultmathsizes

This will make the document use the main text font also in
mathematics mode. With the `italic' option, the Latin letters use
the italic shape in math mode. Digits and log-like operator names
will be upright (if the text font is upright). So one can now
typeset documents (containing simple mathematics formulas) with a
quite arbitrary TeX text font, without worrying too much that nobody
ever designed accompanying math fonts.

If the text font is also available in LGR encoding, then the option
LGRgreek will pick up the Greek letters from the text font in that
encoding. It is also possible to use either the Euler of the
Postscript Symbol font for Greek letters, and they can be scaled by
an arbitrary factor to let them fit better with the document text
font.

As mathastext by default only modifies the font for Latin letters
and typographical characters, almost all in the 32-127 ascii range,
it is possible to let other packages take care of setting up the
math fonts, in particular for the Greek letters (but they should be
loaded before mathastext).

Additionally mathastext provides a simple interface to use different
fonts in the same document, be it for math or text (not that we
recommend abusing it!).

Using mathastext without the `italic' option usually reduces the
size of the final PDF file. The option `symbolmax' will get quite a
few mathematicals glyph from the postscript Symbol font included in
all LaTeX distributions, so that for documents with simple
mathematics, the default math fonts might be completely
avoided. This sometimes leads to smaller PDF files.

CHANGE LOG

1.13b

   *  when the Symbol font is used for \prod and \sum this 
      will be only for inline math; display math will use the
      default glyphs 

1.13

   *  the LGRgreek option is added.

   *  internal changes for better readability of the code.


1.12

   *  various bugs have been corrected.

   *  the endash and alldelims options are active by default.

   *  the package is more Unicode aware.

   *  the \Mathastext command has been improved to
      facilitate the mechanism of math versions also when
      using XeTeX or LuaTeX (with package fontspec.) 

   *  the en-dash and dotless i and j now work with all
      encodings, Unicode inclusive.
