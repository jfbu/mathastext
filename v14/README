DESCRIPTION

Optimal typographical results for documents containing mathematical
symbols can only be hoped for with math fonts specifically designed to
match a given text typeface. Although the list of freely available math
fonts (alongside the Computer Modern and AMS extension fonts) is slowly
expanding (fourier, kpfonts, mathdesign, pxfonts, txfonts, newpx, newtx,
...) it remains limited, and the situation is even worse with Unicode
fonts (XeTeX/LuaTeX). So if you can't find a math font which fits well
with your favorite text font, and wish to still be able to typeset
mathematical documents, perhaps not of the highest typographical
quality, but at least not subjected to obvious visual incompatibilities
between your text font and the math fonts, try out mathastext: it will
simply use the text font also for the math!

-   mathastext.html
-   showcase.html

USAGE

mathastext is a LaTeX package

      \usepackage{mathastext}

The document will use in math mode the text font as configured at
package loading time, for these characters:

      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
      ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
      0123456789
      !?,.:;+-=()[]/#$%&<>|{}\

Main options: italic, frenchmath, subdued, LGRgreek.

-   Use the italic option to get the Latin letters in math mode be in
    italics. Digits and log-like operator names (pre-defined as well as
    user-defined) will be in the same shape as the text font (usually
    this means upright).
-   each \Mathastext[<name>] in the preamble defines a math version to
    be later activated in the document body via the command
    \MTversion{<name>}.
-   With the subdued option, mathastext will be active only inside such
    math versions.
-   For documents needing Greek letters the following is possible:
    -   no option: Greek letters defined by other packages,
    -   eulergreek: use the Euler font for the Greek letters,
    -   symbolgreek: use the Postscript Symbol font for the Greek
        letters.
    -   LGRgreek: use the document text font in LGR encoding. Further
        options specify the shape of the lowercase and uppercase Greek
        glyphs; starting with v1.15c it is possible to use multiple
        distinct LGR fonts in the same document.
-   Commands are provided to scale the Euler and Symbol fonts by an
    arbitrary factor to let them fit better with the document text font.
-   \MTsetmathskips allows to set up extra spacings around letters.

RECENT CHANGES

1.4e [2024/10/26]

-   Fix a bug dating back to 1.3y which caused under LGRgreek or
    LGRgreeks options an \MTversion{normal} to raise an Extra   \else
    error (not if subdued). The unit test which could have shown this
    had been left aside at 1.4d because it was so old that some matters
    unrelated to the package prevented its immediate use... alas...

-   Fix one more 1.4 regression: the (not really recommended) option
    unimathaccents was broken. Again a test file existed but it had been
    left apart from those automatically built, for some unknown
    reason...

1.4d [2024/10/26]

-   Fix one more 1.4 regression (the worst one by far): $f''$ caused a
    crash. Fortunately, the everymath option which re-enacts legacy code
    could be used as a temporary emergency work-around. Thanks to Enrico
    Gregorio for report.

-   The 1.4b option noletters did not prevent the package from defining
    math mode symbols \inodot and \jnodot. It now does.

-   Fix a longstanding legacy bug which would have caused a crash if
    \MTnonlettersobeymathxx had been used with XeLaTeX in a document
    with the character - being a Babel shorthand.

-   Usage of \Mathastext or \MTDeclareVersion to declare a math version
    associated with an exotic non-text font encoding such as OML is
    theoretically possible (although of dubious practical use except for
    stress tests) but was broken since 1.3u due to internals relying on
    LaTeX commands associated with text font encodings (for example to
    define \inodot using \i, or the \hbar with the help of the accent
    command \=) and which are not available in such context. This
    release handles such situation gracefully via warnings, rather than
    causing low level errors.

-   Improve looks in the PDF of this Change log.

1.4c [2024/10/21]

-   Fix a regression at 1.4: under XeLaTeX, loading mathastext caused an
    error if unicode-math and its \setmathfont had been used prior
    ("Extended mathchar used as mathchar" in relation to the minus sign
    character). Thanks to Michael Roland for report.

    Keep in mind though that the documentation (see 1.4.15 Unicode
    engines) has always said that the package "is expected to be most
    definitely incompatible with unicode-math".

-   Fix another regression at 1.4, related to the same code and also
    avoided with everymath option, but showing with all engines. It
    caused \MTnonlettersdonotobeymathxx, if used, to reset the minus
    sign to its status as prior to the loading of mathastext, whereas it
    should have used the (by default) mathversion dependent one (which
    defaults to the en-dash in the font encoding as stored by mathastext
    in the extended math version).

-   \Relbar and \relbar redeclarations (needed as they are used by LaTeX
    for arrows, and the equal and minus signs if picked from the text
    font may not work well in-there) are now done via
    \DeclareRobustCommand also with package amsmath to match the current
    behavior of the latter. Note though that they will use the equal and
    minus signs as in place at package loading time, the documentation
    does say that mathastext should be loaded last.

1.4b [2024/07/27]

-   Fix a regression at 1.4 regarding option nodigits.

-   New option: noletters. I am in old age now so I can provide an
    option completely antithetical to my life work.

-   Option everymath which is destined to be removed at next major
    release warns user about it. As major releases tend to happen once
    per decade I think the constant nagging will become insufferable and
    you will adapt to the 1.4 changes rather than persisting into using
    this option.

1.4a [2024/07/20]

-   There was a documentation glitch in 1.4 and also a problem with the
    \MTprimeskip feature being lost under the emergency fall-back
    everymath option.

1.4 [2024/07/20]

-   Since 1.2 of 2012/12/20, mathastext has used mathematically active
    characters to propose certain advanced functionalities. For reasons
    half lost in the mists of time but whose main one was surely to keep
    the meaning of the active shape of characters unchanged outside of
    math mode, this mathematical activation, and (in most cases) the
    definitions of what active characters do, were done again at each
    entrance into math mode. At this 1.4 release, mathastext does not
    inject any code whatsoever into the \everymath and \everydisplay
    toks registers anymore (except for one font-related hack needed
    under LuaLaTeX, see below). Your documents will compile a tiny bit
    faster.

-   In (unsual) documents where users play with catcodes and mathcodes
    it is impossible to keep exact backward compatibility, because
    documented user commands which acted formerly as toggles with
    delayed action now will enact changes immediately if in the document
    body. In practice consequences are expected to be few, because
    catcode active characters are (as was already the case with earlier
    releases) hacked only when they are Babel shorthands and they are
    then modified in a way altering only their action in math mode. The
    precise description of what mathastext does when mathematically
    activating (or not) a character, depending on circumstances, is to
    be found among small-print comments in the section "Extended scope
    of the math alphabets commands". See also the documentation of the
    \MTmathactiveletters command for some specifics regarding ascii
    letters.

-   New option: everymath. It instructs mathastext to revert (partially)
    to its legacy code which uses \everymath/\everydisplay. This
    reversal is partial, the handling of ascii letters not being
    included into it. The everymath option is there only to try as a
    quick fix in case transition to this release causes a major problem
    in a user document and time is lacking to investigate. Please report
    to the author such issues. Option everymath is destined to be
    removed at next major release.

-   New option: activedigits. Enjoy.

-   It is now easier to hook into the mathastext architecture for
    mathematically activated ascii letters. See the new section "Hacking
    letters (and even digits) for special tasks".

-   Bugfix: do not override special behavior of the math mode dot in
    babel-spanish.

-   Bugfix: A desperate hack related to LuaLaTeX font matters and dating
    back to 1.3o 2016/05/03 had been for some years in dire need of an
    update regarding fonts using Renderer=HarfBuzz. This is done now.
    Thanks to tex.sx user691586 for report. This is currently the sole
    remaining usage of \everymath/\everydisplay.

-   Bugfix: \MTexplicitbracesobeymathxx (which is related to \{ and \})
    was without effect since an upstream LaTeX change at its 2020-02-02
    release.

-   With option symbolmisc, those math symbol macros formerly defined
    via \DeclareRobustCommand are now declared via \protected\def.

-   Removal of legacy branches previously kept to support LaTeX earlier
    than 2020-02-02.

-   Removal of support for EU1 and EU2 font encodings.

-   Option noasterisk deprecated at 1.2d 2013/01/02 has (finally) been
    removed.

-   Four test files previously included and auto-extracted from the
    distributed dtx have been dropped. One of them is still available on
    the package homepage.

-   Some parts of the documentation have been massively re-ordered and
    even to some extent improved. But there may be some occasions where
    obsolete statements will be found having the legacy
    \everymath/\everydisplay situation as background.
